instructions for use
Step 1: Put the "Whitelist Tablet" prefab in your scene

Step 2: unpack the prefab completely and remove the white box.

step 3: move the white box to wherever you want to be, whitelist access only, and resize. Whatever that box covers will only be accessible by whitelisted users.

step 4: make sure the whitelist is connected to the collider script (on the white box) and the tablets' whitelist manager. 

Step 5: Place the tablet wherever you want and test it out.

Note: the whitelist in the tablet throws an error saying it needs an upgrade. Just ignore that and delete the component that is saying that.

Note: the world owner or "master" is always whitelisted.

How to use the tablet: 

1) Non-whitelisted users press the request button
2) a whitelisted user accepts or denies the request
3) You can scroll the whitelist with the arrows and kick people off with the deny button.
